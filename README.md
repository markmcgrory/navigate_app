# navigate_app
Hello and thank you for checking out Navigate; an application created by Mark, Ibrahim, Matthew, and Emma during the CodeClan intensive professional software development course.

**What is Navigate?**
Navigate is an internal application for the social services. We wanted to create an app that could store service users and support services data, allowing the user to add, update and assign users to services around Glasgow. 

This application is currently in its version 1 as we would love to take some additional time to add additional features.

Navigate was born from Matthew’s experiences in the Social Care Services sector in Glasgow, where system did not communicate with each other. Additionally, most applications the services are using are marketing-based applications that don’t fully meet the organisation’s needs.

**How to start up Navigate locally?**
After cloning the repo or downloading the application as a .zip file and extracting its contents, please follow the steps below;
1.	Open the Navigate application within Visual Studio Code (VSC)
2.	Open the server folder and run the code below in the terminal;
  a.	npm install
3.	Seed the database with example data by running the code below in the same terminal;
  a.	npm run seeds
4.	To run the server with database, run the code below in the same terminal;
  a.	npm start
5.	Open the src folder in the terminal and run the code below in the terminal;
  a.	npm install
6.	To run the application in your local browser run the code below in the terminal;
  a.	npm start
